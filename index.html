      <img src="assets/images/portrait.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

      <p>â€œAfter graduating with an Associates Degree in Electronic Engineering in 2015 and working at couple different companies, I discovered that I really prefer software a lot more than hardware. I learned both in college, I took classes in Java and C as well as AC and DC circuits, and microprocessors etc."</p>

      <p>"So after my experiences, it was then I decided to start teaching myself using online resources such as Udemy. There I received certificates from courses in Python and SQL. After completing those courses and doing some research on the industry, I decided that starting to learn Web Development should be my next step, and I'm so happy I did. I took The Complete Web Developer Course 2.0 on Udemy by Rob Percival. A highly rated course and I would recommend it! There I learned HTML5, CSS3, javascript, jQuery, Wordpress, Bootstrap and Responsive Layouts for the front end as well as PHP and MySQL for the backend. I can't wait to learn more!"</p>
